Filter out the events on the basis of multiple categories
Let's you create private Notification for any geographical area only
Shows all the events real time on the map
Notifications can be created by any individual/government/non-governmental groups or societies
Since each Notification is bound to a geographical area hence can only be seen by a person in a specific radius
